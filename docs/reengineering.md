# Reengineering (再造工程)

  - [再造工程 \- 維基百科，自由的百科全書](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/再造工程)

      - 再造工程（或簡稱「再造」），對應英文「Reengineering」，是在 1990 年代初期風靡全世界的重要管理概念。

      - 再造工程（或簡稱「再造」）作為特定概念，對應英文「Reengineering」一詞，正式的提出，是 Michael Hammer (1990)。他在這篇文章中以 Reengineering 為核心概念，探討了怎樣大幅度地改進業務表現，和人們在實踐和觀念上的一些盲點或誤區。他敘述到：

        > "We should 'reengineer' our businesses: use the power of modern INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY to radically REDESIGN our BUSINESS PROCESSES in order to achieve dramatic improvements in their PERFORMANCE."

       「我們將『再造』我們的業務：用現代信息技術的能力徹底地重新設計 (redesign) 我們的業務流程，以戲劇性地改進它們的表現。」

      - 使這個詞真正走向世界的是 1993 年 Michael Hammer 和 James Champy 合著的《再造公司》一書。在這本書中，對 Reengineering 更進一步界定如下：

        > "'Reengineering,' properly,is 'the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary MEASURES OF PERFORMANCE, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.'

       「『再造工程』，完整地說，是『對業務流程根本性地重新思考及徹底重新設計，以達成在苛刻的當代度量標準，諸如成本、品質、服務及速度上的戲劇性改進』。」

      - 《公司再造》一書，僅僅出版一年半，就售出 170 萬冊，被翻譯成 19 種文字。據調查，1994 年，美國 75%-80% 的大公司已經開始實施再造，由此可見當年的熱度。

    四個關鍵字和一個中心

      - 在《再造公司》一書中，歸納了「再造工程」的4個關鍵詞：

          - 根本的 (fundamental)： 從「為什麼做，為什麼這樣做？」這種最基本的地方開始反思，拋棄一切理所當然的前提。
          - 徹底的 (radical)： 從根基上重新設計，不是「改進」而是「革命」。
          - 戲劇性的 (dramatic)： 不是改造提高，而是躍遷 (quantum leaps)
          - 流程 (process)： 這是最重要的詞。業務流程是提供對客戶有價值的輸出的一系列活動。

      - 在上述「要點」中，真正實質性的、核心的是「流程」，這一點在隨後的發展之中逐漸成為廣泛的共識。Machael Hammer 在 1996年出版的另一本著作《超越再造工程》中，也反映出這一點，他寫到：

       > 「徹底這個特徵對於再造工程固然重要和令人興奮，但並不是其最重要的方面。再造工程定義中的關鍵字是『流程』：一系列從終點到終點的完整活動，這些活動一起為顧客創造價值。」

    企業再造與業務流程再造

      - 從歷史的發展看，對於流程的重新發現和重新界定，以「流程中心組織」改造傳統的面向職能分工的金字塔型組織，是這場「再造運動」更實質性和長久的貢獻之一。因此，「再造工程」這一名詞更多地與業務流程捆綁在一起使用，即「企業流程再造」（BPR）。

        應當區別作為一個單獨概念的再造工程（Reengineering）與業務流程再造（BPR）的聯繫與區別。

        我們可以對企業內特定的流程進行再造，也可以對一個企業（整體）進行再造。當對一個企業進行再造的時候，核心的任務就是對其包含的（也可能有多個）業務流程進行再造，而對核心業務流程再造的結果，總是會導致（或需要）對整個組織的架構、職能、資源配置等等作出改變——圍繞著核心業務流程來重新塑造企業。

        --> 也就是說，Reengineering 可以用在很多地方，當用在業務流程時我們稱之為 BPR。

      - 經過這樣的再造後，企業常見的一個外在變化就是組織層次的減少。

  - [Business process re\-engineering \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering) #ril

      - Business process re-engineering (BPR) is a business management strategy, originally pioneered in the early 1990s, focusing on the ANALYSIS AND DESIGN of WORKFLOWS and BUSINESS PROCESSES within an organization.

        BPR aimed to help organizations FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINK how they do their work in order to improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.

      - BPR seeks to help companies RADICALLY restructure their organizations by focusing on the ground-up design of their business processes. According to early BPR proponent Thomas H. Davenport (1990), a business process is a set of logically related tasks performed to achieve a defined BUSINESS OUTCOME.

        Re-engineering emphasized a holistic focus on BUSINESS OBJECTIVES and how processes related to them, encouraging FULL-SCALE RECREATION of processes rather than iterative optimization of sub-processes.

        --> 其中 radical 跟 dramatic 倒是與我在《從 A 到 A+》裡看到的「透過非格命性的過程，促成了革命性的改變」想法不太一樣。

      - Business process reengineering is also known as business process redesign, business transformation, or business process CHANGE MANAGEMENT.

    Overview

      - Business process reengineering (BPR) is the practice of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs.

        Organizations reengineer two key areas of their businesses. First, they use MODERN TECHNOLOGY to enhance DATA DISSEMINATION and DECISION-MAKING processes. Then, they alter FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATIONS to form FUNCTIONAL TEAMS.

        Functional Organization → Functional Team 好像就是[再造工程](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/再造工程)中所講的 "改造傳統的面向職能分工的金字塔型組織 ... 組織層次的減少"。

        [Reengineering guidance and relationship of mission and work processes to information technology.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Reengineering_guidence.jpg/480px-Reengineering_guidence.jpg)

      - Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and customer needs. Basic questions are asked, such as "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?"

        An organization may find that it is operating on QUESTIONABLE ASSUMPTIONS, particularly in terms of the wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, it does go on to decide how best to do it.

      - Within the framework of this basic assessment of mission and goals, re-engineering focuses on the organization's business processes—the steps and procedures that govern how RESOURCES are used to create products and services that meet the needs of particular customers or markets.

        As a structured ordering of work steps across time and place, a business process can be decomposed into specific activities, measured, modeled, and improved. It can also be completely redesigned or ELIMINATED altogether.

        Re-engineering identifies, analyzes, and re-designs an organization's core business processes with the aim of achieving improvements in CRITICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.

      - Re-engineering recognizes that an organization's business processes are usually FRAGMENTED into sub-processes and tasks that are carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, NO ONE is responsible for the OVERALL PERFORMANCE of the entire process.

        因為分工而不合作，沒有人在看整體。

        Reengineering maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process AS A WHOLE in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers.

        This drive for realizing improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.

    Topics

      - The most notable definitions of reengineering are:

          - "... the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve ... improvements in critical contemporary modern measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed."

          - "encompasses the envisioning of new work strategies, the actual process design activity, and the implementation of the change in all its complex technological, HUMAN, and ORGANIZATIONAL DIMENSIONS."

            在 [History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering#Development_after_1995) 中主要被批評的點是沒有考量到 "人性"。

      - BPR is different from other approaches to organization development (OD), especially the continuous improvement or TQM movement, by virtue of its aim for fundamental and radical change rather than ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT.

        不過這一點在 [Development after 1995](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering#Development_after_1995) 被修正為 "typically performed in a less radical way than originally proposed"。

      - BPR derives its existence from different disciplines, and four major areas can be identified as being subjected to change in BPR – organization, technology, strategy, and people – where a process view is used as COMMON FRAMEWORK for considering these dimensions. ??

        Business strategy is the primary driver of BPR initiatives and the other dimensions are governed by strategy's encompassing role.

        The organization dimension reflects the structural elements of the company, such as hierarchical levels, the composition of organizational units, and the distribution of work between them.

        Technology is concerned with the use of computer systems and other forms of communication technology in the business. In BPR, information technology is generally considered to act as enabler of new forms of organizing and collaborating, RATHER THAN supporting existing business functions. ??

        The people / human resources dimension deals with aspects such as education, training, MOTIVATION and REWARD systems.

        The concept of business processes – interrelated activities aiming at creating a value added output to a customer – is the basic underlying idea of BPR. These processes are characterized by a number of attributes: PROCESS OWNERSHIP, CUSTOMER FOCUS, VALUE ADDING, and CROSS-FUNCTIONALITY.

        這裡的 process ownership 強調的是 "overall performance of the entire process"。

## Information Technology {: #it }

  - [History - Business process re\-engineering \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering#History)

      - BPR began as a private sector technique to help organizations rethink how they do their work in order to improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors.

        A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of INFORMATION SYSTEMS and networks. Organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.

    Development after 1995

      - With the publication of critiques in 1995 and 1996 by some of the early BPR proponents, coupled with abuses and MISUSES of the concept by others, the reengineering fervor in the U.S. began to wane.

        Since then, considering business processes as a starting point for business analysis and redesign has become a widely accepted approach and is a standard part of the change methodology portfolio, but is typically performed in a LESS RADICAL WAY than originally proposed.

        1990 初開始風行，到 1995 年後開始勢微，時間也太短?

      - More recently, the concept of Business Process Management (BPM) has gained major attention in the corporate world and can be considered a successor to the BPR wave of the 1990s, as it is evenly driven by a striving for PROCESS EFFICIENCY supported by INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.

        Equivalently to the critique brought forward against BPR, BPM is now accused of focusing on technology and disregarding the people aspects of change..

        確實 BPM 大家想到的都是系統本身，重點還是 business process 的 rethinking/redesigning。

    Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990

      - In 1990, Michael Hammer, a former professor of computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published the article "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate" in the Harvard Business Review, in which he claimed that the major challenge for managers is to OBLITERATE forms of work that DO NOT ADD VALUE, rather than using technology for automating it.

        This statement implicitly accused managers of having focused on the WRONG ISSUES, namely that technology in general, and more specifically information technology, has been used primarily for automating EXISTING processes rather than using it as an ENABLER for making non-value adding work obsolete.

        很多時候使用者希望幫忙做系統，但如果只是單純地把現有流程加速，而不重新想過流程可以怎麼 redesign，就會掉入這個陷阱。很多時候，我們必須分析問題的源頭，而非單純用科技解決流程末端的問題 -- Fail Fast。

        Hammer's claim was simple: Most of the work being done does not add any value for customers, and this work should be removed, not accelerated through automation. Instead, companies should reconsider their INABILITY to satisfy customer needs, and their insufficient cost structure.

      - Even well-established management thinkers, such as Peter Drucker and Tom Peters, were accepting and advocating BPR as a new TOOL for (re-)achieving success in a dynamic world. During the following years, a fast-growing number of publications, books as well as journal articles, were dedicated to BPR, and many consulting firms embarked on this trend and developed BPR methods.

        However, the critics were fast to claim that BPR was a way to DEHUMANIZE the work place, increase managerial control, and to justify downsizing, i.e. major reductions of the work force, and a rebirth of Taylorism under a different label. ??

      - Despite this critique, reengineering was adopted at an accelerating pace and by 1993, as many as 60% of the Fortune 500 companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.

        This trend was fueled by the fast adoption of BPR by the consulting industry, but also by the study Made in America, conducted by MIT, that showed how companies in many US industries had lagged behind their foreign counterparts in terms of competitiveness, time-to-market and productivity.

        其中 productivity 只是 Reengineering 可以改善的指標之一。

    Topics

      - In order to achieve the major improvements BPR is seeking for, the change of structural organizational variables, and other ways of managing and performing work is often considered insufficient.

        For being able to reap the achievable benefits fully, the use of information technology (IT) is conceived as a MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. While IT traditionally has been used for supporting the existing business functions, i.e. it was used for increasing organizational efficiency, it now plays a role as ENABLER of new organizational forms, and patterns of collaboration within and between organizations.

  - [The role of information technology - Business process re\-engineering \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering#The_role_of_information_technology)

      - Information technology (IT) has historically played an important role in the reengineering concept. It is regarded by some as a major enabler for new forms of working and collaborating within an organization and across organizational borders.

        這裡 "major enabler" 的說法，違反了上面 "Reengineering Work: Don't Automate, Obliterate, 1990" 一節的警示。

      - BPR literature identified several so called disruptive technologies that were supposed to challenge TRADITIONAL WISDOM about how work should be performed.

          - Shared databases, making information available at many places
          - EXPERT SYSTEMS, allowing generalists to perform specialist tasks
          - Telecommunication networks, allowing organizations to be centralized and decentralized at the same time
          - DECISION-SUPPORT TOOLS, allowing decision-making to be a part of EVERYBODY'S JOB
          - Wireless data communication and portable computers, allowing field personnel to work office independent
          - Interactive videodisk, to get in immediate contact with potential buyers ??
          - Automatic identification and tracking, allowing things to tell where they are, instead of requiring to be found ??
          - High performance computing, allowing on-the-fly planning and revisioning

      - In the mid-1990s especially, workflow management systems were considered a significant contributor to improved process efficiency. Also, ERP (enterprise resource planning) vendors, such as SAP, JD Edwards, Oracle, and PeopleSoft, positioned their solutions as vehicles for business process redesign and improvement.

## Practice

  - [Factors for success and failure - Business process re\-engineering \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_re-engineering#Factors_for_success_and_failure) #ril

      - Factors that are important to BPR success include:

          - BPR team composition.
          - Business needs analysis.
          - Adequate IT infrastructure.
          - Effective change management. ??
          - Ongoing continuous improvement

      - The aspects of a BPM effort that are modified include organizational structures, management systems, employee responsibilities, and performance measurements, INCENTIVE systems, skills development, and the use of IT.

        BPR can potentially affect every aspect of how business is conducted today. Wholesale changes can cause results ranging from enviable success to complete failure.

        If successful, a BPM initiative can result in improved quality, customer service, and competitiveness, as well as reductions in cost or cycle time. However, 50-70% of reengineering projects are either failures or do not achieve significant benefit.

        失敗率很高 XD!

      - There are many reasons for sub-optimal business processes which include:

          - One department may be optimized AT THE EXPENSE OF ANOTHER
          - Lack of time to focus on improving business process
          - Lack of recognition of the extent of the problem
          - Lack of training

          - People involved use the best tool they have at their disposal which is usually Excel to fix problems

            什麼都用 Excel 解決 XD!

          - Inadequate infrastructure
          - Overly BUREAUCRATIC processes
          - Lack of motivation

      - Many unsuccessful BPR attempts may have been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed. Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made but did not know which areas to change or how to change them. As a result, process reengineering is a management concept that has been formed by TRIAL AND ERROR or, in other words, practical experience.

        As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent. To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process. ??

        Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.
