## Feature Release

  - [Feature Release Guidebook \| Workday Community](https://community.workday.com/FeatureReleaseGuidebook)

      - Workday delivers enhancements every week during the WEEKLY Service Update and more significant enhancements and features in the Workday Feature Releases TWICE A YEAR.

        更新分兩種 -- 每週的 Service Update，及每年 2 次的 Feature Release。

      - This guidebook provides a framework for DEVELOPING a plan and a repeatable process to be executed with the twice annual Workday Feature Releases. It is the central location for feature release planning, learning, and testing information.

        每個 Workday 用戶都應該發展出自己的 SOP，以因應每年 2 次的 Feature Release。

      - Customers can preview new features and functionality for five weeks in advance of the Feature Release. At the conclusion of the PREVIEW WINDOW, the Feature Release is delivered to ALL TENANT TYPES ON THE SAME DATE.

        時間到就會全上了，只有 5 週的時間可以反應；這由 Preview Windows 標準的說法是 Release Preparation Window。

      - Learn How Workday Delivers Features and review Workday's Feature Release Process FAQ. These references provide important information for customers who are live on Workday, as well as customers implementing Workday.

  - [Workday's Feature Release Process FAQ \| Workday Community](https://community.workday.com/node/78430) #ril

      - This FAQ provides clarity around what customers can expect related to the update process with upcoming Feature Releases. We've also included information regarding the use of Preview tenants. This information is important for customers already live on Workday and for customers and project teams in Implementation.

    Feature Release Process Questions

      - Overview of the Feature Release Process

          - Workday updates all tenant types on the same date.

          - All new features coming in the Feature Release will be available in Preview tenants 5 weeks prior to the release date. The benefit is that customers will be able to see the new release in their Sandbox Preview tenant and/or their Implementation Preview tenant.

            If you do not have an Implementation Preview tenant today, you may request that one of your current Implementation tenants be transformed to an Implementation Preview. This Implementation Preview tenant will remain a Preview tenant and continue, release over release, to receive new features as they are made available.

            根據 [Tenant Management](https://community.workday.com/articles/24324) 的說法，理論上新客戶一定會有 Production、Sandbox 及 Sandbox Preview 3 個 tenant，不知道什麼情況會沒有 Sandbox Preview 而要走 Implementation Preview ??

          - Important to note: Twice a year at the beginning of the RELEASE PREPARATION WINDOW, the Sandbox Preview tenant is auto-refreshed from a copy of Production taken on that Friday at 6:00 pm PT. Sandbox Preview Exemptions are not permitted.

            The remainder of the year, the Sandbox Preview tenant is only refreshed from production when a Named Support Contact enters a Refresh Tenant Request during one of the TENANT MAINTENANCE WINDOWS.
