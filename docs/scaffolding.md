# Scaffolding

  - [Scaffold \(programming\) \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaffold_(programming))

      - Scaffolding, as used in computing, refers to one of two techniques: The first is a CODE GENERATION technique related to DATABASE ACCESS in some model–view–controller frameworks; the second is a PROJECT GENERATION technique supported by various tools.

    Project generation

      - Complicated software projects often SHARE CERTAIN CONVENTIONS ON PROJECT STRUCTURE and requirements. For example, they often have separate folders for source code, binaries and code tests, as well as files containing license agreements, release notes and contact information. To simplify the creation of projects following those conventions, "scaffolding" tools can automatically generate them at the beginning of each project. Such tools include Yeoman and Cargo.

        Cargo 是 Rust 的 build system 及 package manager，跟 project generation 好像沒有關係?
