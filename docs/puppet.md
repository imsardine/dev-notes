## Puppet Enterprise (PE) vs. Open Source {: #enterprise-vs-opensource }

  - [The Value of Puppet Enterprise – PE and Open Source \| Puppet\.com](https://puppet.com/resources/solution-brief/value-puppet-enterprise-pe-and-open-source/) #ril

    As the most popular collection of open source projects for defining infrastructure as code and enforcing system configurations, open source Puppet is great for individuals managing a SMALL SET of servers. But when you have complex or large infrastructure that’s used and managed by different teams, Puppet Enterprise is the way to go.
