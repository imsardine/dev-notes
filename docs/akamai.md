    Network optimizations to deliver rich, dynamically generated content

      - Your users are unique and they expect experiences that are fast and PERSONAL. In fact, 53% of people abandon a site that takes over 3 seconds to load. You on the other hand, need to provide rich, interactive and dynamic applications to meet those increasing user expectations. This can make the pages heavier and risk user experience.

      - Built on the SLA-backed bedrock of Akamai’s global cloud delivery platform, Dynamic Site Accelerator provides improved reliability, offload, and network performance over your ORIGINAL WEB INFRASTRUCTURE, while handling the specific requirements of dynamically generated content — without a costly hardware build-out. Using real-time network optimizations and advanced caching techniques, it speeds and secures interactive websites, helping you scale immediately and easily meet SUDDEN NEEDS like holiday shopping or flash sales.
