      - 1-Wire is a DEVICE COMMUNICATIONS BUS SYSTEM designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp. that provides low-speed (16.3kbps) data, signaling, and power over a SINGLE CONDUCTOR.

      - 1-Wire is similar in concept to I²C, but with lower data rates and LONGER RANGE. It is typically used to communicate with SMALL INEXPENSIVE DEVICES such as digital thermometers and weather instruments. A NETWORK of 1-Wire devices with an associated MASTER device is called a MicroLAN.

      - One distinctive feature of the bus is the possibility of USING ONLY TWO WIRES: data and ground. To accomplish this, 1-Wire devices include an 800 pF capacitor to store charge and power the device during periods when the data line is active.

        因為低耗電的關係，電源由內部的電容供應即可。
