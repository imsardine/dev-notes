  - [Announcing Workday 2020 Release 1 \| Workday Community](https://community.workday.com/articles/607165)

      - We are pleased to provide you with this summary of the most highly anticipated features and enhancements planned for Workday 2020 Release 1.

        We'll publish the What’s New posts on the Community and the What’s New in Workday report on January 24, 1 week prior to the release preparation window.

        算是 Feature Release 的預告，雖然 Sandbox/Implementation Preview 裡早就有許多新功能；但為什麼下面會有這樣的問答：

        > 2020-01-09 Tiffany Talbert: What day will the Sandbox Preview tenant have the new features?
        >
        > 2020-01-09 Rowan Witebsky (Workday): Currently, these features are planned to deliver in the February 1 service update. If their delivery dates change, we'll provide a What's New delay post with the new intended DELIVERY DATES.

        這裡的 delivery dates 分為 2 種 -- Intended Preview/Production Date。

        What's New in Workday Preview as of 2020-01-03 這份文件裡，可以看到類似 "Preview Date: 2019/12/27, Tentative Production Date: 2020/3/7" 的安排。

    Before You Begin

      - We strongly encourage you to read Announcing and Feature Considerations Document: Purpose and How to Use to familiarize yourself with the information and terminology, as well as our recommendations for using Announcing.

      - IMPORTANT: As you read this document, please keep these 3 points in mind:

          - Announcing and Feature Considerations is only a preview of what we intend to deliver in the next feature release.
          - It is possible that we’ll make changes in direction before the update.
          - This document is NOT a comprehensive listing of the Workday 2020 Release 1 features.

    How to Track Delivery Plans for a Feature

      - We understand that many of you compare the features we list in Announcing to the features we document when the Preview window opens. To aid you in tracking features if we make changes to our delivery plans, we will:

          - Create a What's New Post for the feature to provide you the updated delivery schedule.
          - Tag the post with the RED Delivery Change icon.

      - You can subscribe to the What's New Post to receive notifications if we make further changes. We’ll keep these posts updated with projected delivery dates.

    Additional Resources

      - You may want to review the list of [Brainstorm](https://community.workday.com/brainstorms?f%5B0%5D=release%3A4916) ideas targeted for delivery in Workday 2020 Release 1.

    All Products Combined (Excel Spreadsheet)

      - In addition to a post on the Workday Community, we provide the Announcing and Feature Considerations information in the attached Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for all product areas.

        Announcing and Feature Considerations 2020R1 ALL

        這份文件跟下面 What's New in Workday Preview as of 2020-01-03 的差別?? 如果這裡是 ALL，項目應該比 as of 2020-01-03 還多，為什麼後者有 101 項，而前者 ALL 只有 50 幾項?? 為什麼後者要從 1/3 起算??

    Features Already Delivered to Preview

      - To help you plan for Workday 2020 Release 1, we also provide the What's New in Workday documentation for features ALREADY DELIVERED to your Preview tenant (as of today's date) that we plan to deliver to your Production tenant as part of 2020R1 on 2020-03-07.
