# [Workday](workday.md) / Community

  - 帳號跟 Workday (production) 是分開的，要按 Request Account 申請；提供 Business Email Address 及 Reason for Account Request，會先收到一封信：

    > We’ve sent your request for a Workday Community account to your organization. Once it’s processed, you will receive an email confirmation.

    後端由 Community Administrator 核準後會收到內容有 "Your Community username is: xxx" 的信件 (其中 `xxx` 是系統幫忙取的)，下面有 Set Your Password 的按鈕。

    Approve or Deny New User Requests

      - You will receive an email when someone from your organization requests an account on their own. You can approve or deny user account requests from the Awaiting Approval tab on the Members tab of your organization.

        這位置很不直覺 Profile > Organization > Members。

      - To access the Awaiting Approval tab:

        From your Community profile, click your company name and then go to the Members tab.

      - Click Awaiting Approval.

        You can EDIT NAMES or email addresses at this stage.

        可以修改 full name，但帳號還是只能由系統來取。

      - Click:

          - Approve: Creates account and sends email with login instructions to new member.
          - Deny: Member receives email that their request was denied. If you provide a reason, it DOESN'T DISPLAY in the email.
