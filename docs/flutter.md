  - [Flutter \- Beautiful native apps in record time](https://flutter.io/) #ril
      - Flutter allows you to build beautiful NATIVE apps on iOS and Android from a SINGLE CODEBASE.
      - Coming from another platform? Docs: iOS, Android, Web, React Native, Xamarin. 想吸收不同平台的開發者，野心不小!!
      - Fast Development - Paint your app to life in milliseconds with stateful Hot Reload. Use a rich set of fully-customizable widgets to build NATIVE INTERFACES in minutes.

        Flutter's hot reload helps you quickly and easily experiment, build UIs, add features, and fix bugs faster. Experience sub-second reload times, without losing state, on emulators, simulators, and hardware for iOS and Android. 跟 Android Studio 的 Instant Run 有點像。

      - Expressive and Flexible UI - Quickly ship features with a focus on native end-user experiences. Layered architecture allows for full customization, which results in incredibly FAST RENDERING and expressive and flexible designs.

        Delight your users with Flutter's built-in beautiful Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-flavor) widgets, rich motion APIs, smooth natural scrolling, and PLATFORM AWARENESS.

      - Native Performance - Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full NATIVE PERFORMANCE on both iOS and Android. 這正是其他跨平台方案最為人垢病的點!!

        Flutter’s widgets incorporate all critical platform differences such as scrolling, navigation, icons and fonts to provide full native performance on both iOS and Android.

  - [Google is one step closer to replacing Android with something even more exciting – BGR](https://bgr.com/2018/12/04/fuchsia-vs-android-flutter-1-0-coding-toolkit-released/) (2018-12-04)
      - But Google isn’t just developing a new OS for the future of computing. It’s also working on a new coding engine that would let developers easily deploy apps on ALL PLATFORMS, including Apple’s iOS. If all this sounds familiar, that’s because Google released a Flutter beta in late February at MWC 2018, which developers can use to code apps for Android and iOS. On Tuesday, Google announced that the FIRST STABLE VERSION of Flutter is available for everyone to try, complete with many improvements as well as new features.
      - Flutter’s main advantage over other coding alternatives, at least as far as Google is concerned, is that it allows developers to create apps for both Android and iPhone platforms a lot faster than before. Even though we’re not in the early days of app development for iPhone and Android, developers still favor iOS over Android in many cases, and some TITLES hit iPhones and iPads before they’re available in the Play store. With Flutter, companies won’t have to invest in two development teams, one for each major mobile OS. 不用投資兩個開發團隊，確實是個很大的誘因；下面提到 "iOS or Android-first" 的問題。
      - A comment from Capital One’s senior director of engineering featured in Google’s press release perfectly explains why Flutter is great for the future of Android, emphasis ours:
          - We are excited by Flutter’s unique take on HIGH-PERFORMING cross-platform development. Our engineers have appreciated the rapid development promise, and HOT RELOAD capabilities, and over the past year we have seen tremendous progress in the framework and especially the NATIVE INTEGRATION story.
          - Flutter can allow Capital One to think of features not in an ‘iOS or Android-first’ fashion, but rather in a true MOBILE-FIRST model. We are excited to see Flutter 1.0 and continue to be impressed with the pace of advancement and the excitement in the engineering community.
      - With Flutter, Google hopes that companies will code all their new apps at the same time and then deploy them simultaneously on iPhone and Android. When the time comes, Flutter will LIKELY also allow developers to create iOS and Fuchsia apps simultaneously. Flutter should make porting Android apps to Fuchsia much easier.

        注意 "iOS and Fuchsia apps" 的說法，已經不提 Android 了；若 Fuchsia 本身就可以執行 Android app，那 Flutter 為什麼有助於 Android 的遷移??

        It’s an open source project too, which means that it’ll support other coding tools out there like Kotlin and Java for Android, and Swift and Objective-C for iOS. 還是需要寫 Android 或 iOS 專用的程式??

      - Announced at Flutter Live, Flutter 1.0 doesn’t just allow cross-platform app development on a SINGLE CODEBASE. It also brings over several features that should make it appealing to use. Flutter should allow developers to build beautiful apps that will adhere to both Google’s Material Design guidelines and Apple’s design guidelines. In fact, the iOS Settings screenshot below was created in Flutter. 就像原生的一樣!!
      - Flutter should also be faster to use, supporting “glitch-free, jank-free graphics” at the NATIVE SPEEDS. Flutter supports a “STATEFUL HOT RELOAD” feature, which lets developers make changes to their apps while they’re testing them without restarting or losing the state of the app. 若 Flutter 能兼顧速度，表現出來又像是原生 app，就真的無敵了!!
      - Flutter 1.0 brings a couple of notable new features, including “Add to App,” which will let developers UPDATE EXISTING APPS with the help of Flutter, or CONVERT EXISTING APPS in stages. “Platform Views” is a new Flutter trick that will let users add UI features to existing apps with the help of Flutter, like the transparent “Go to London” button in the following screenshots: 動態為別人開發的 app 加點東西??
      - Flutter is already in use internally at Google on apps including Google Maps and Google Ads. But various other developers have already created apps in Flutter, including Capital One, Alibaba, Groupon, Hamilton, JD.com, Philips Hue, Reflectly, and Tencent. Square also announced two Flutter SDKs to bring payment support to apps via Flutter. 起飛了 ~

      - Fuchsia 的 UI 跟 app 用 Flutter 開發 -- 一個橫跨 Fuchsia、iOS 及 Android 的 SDK。
      - Flutter 會產生基於 Dart 的 app，所以 frame rate 可以達到 120 FPS。

### macOS

  - [MacOS install \- Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/macos)
      - Download the following installation bundle to get the latest stable release of the Flutter SDK: `flutter_macos_v1.0.0-stable.zip` (約 430 MB)。
      - Add the `flutter` tool to your path: ``export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"``

    Run `flutter doctor`:

      - Run the following command to see if there are any dependencies you need to install to complete the setup (for verbose output, add the `-v` flag): `flutter doctor`

            $ flutter doctor

      - This command checks your environment and displays a report to the terminal window. The Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter; it is not necessary to install Dart separately. Check the output carefully for other software you may need to install or further tasks to perform (shown in BOLD TEXT). 也就是 error 的部份。
      - The `flutter` tool uses Google Analytics to anonymously report feature USAGE STATISTICS and basic CRASH REPORTS. This data is used to help improve Flutter tools over time. Analytics is not sent on the very first run or for any runs involving `flutter config`, so you can OPT OUT of analytics before any data is sent. To disable reporting, type `flutter config --no-analytics` and to display the current setting, type `flutter config`.

    MacOS supports developing Flutter apps for both iOS and Android.

  - [iOS setup - MacOS install \- Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install/macos#ios-setup)
      - To develop Flutter apps for iOS, you need a Mac with Xcode 9.0 or newer: ... With Xcode, you’ll be able to run Flutter apps on an iOS device or on the simulator.

        不過要執行在 iOS device，除了 Xcode 之外還要裝 iOS toolchain，執行在 simulator 相對單純許多。

      - Configure the Xcode command-line tools to use the newly-installed version of Xcode by running the following from the command line: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
      - Make sure the Xcode license agreement is signed by either opening Xcode once and confirming or running `sudo xcodebuild -license` from the command line. 原來還有這一招!

    Set up the iOS simulator

      - On your Mac, find the Simulator via Spotlight or by using the following command: `open -a Simulator`
      - Make sure your simulator is using a 64-bit device (iPhone 5s or later) by checking the settings in the simulator’s Hardware > Device menu.
      - Depending on your development machine’s screen size, simulated high-screen-density iOS devices may overflow your screen. Set the device scale under the Window > Scale menu in the simulator.

    Create and run a simple Flutter app

      - Create a new Flutter app by running the following from the command line: `flutter create my_app`
      - To launch the app in the Simulator, ensure that the Simulator is running and enter: `flutter run`
