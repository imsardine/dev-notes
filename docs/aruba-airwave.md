      - Aruba AirWave network management

        Offering granular visibility into WIRED AND WIRELESS networks, AirWave is the leading MULTIVENDOR management platform designed for ON-PREMISES CAMPUS environments.

        In support of public health and safety efforts, integration with Aruba Central offers new CONTACT TRACING and LOCATION TRACING capabilities.

        Aruba Central 與 AirWave 的定位有何不同? 其中 contact/location tracing 指的是什麼?

      - Solve connectivity issues before they happen.

        With Connectivity Health, AirWave proactively monitors critical non-RF metrics — the time it takes for a mobile device to associate with a Wi-Fi radio, authenticate to a RADIUS server, gather an IP address through DHCP, or resolve names for DNS services.

        其中 RF 是射頻 (Radio Frequency) 的意思，使用者覺得網路慢可能跟訊號強弱無關，而是在其他環節。

        Custom alerts and SIMULATED CLIENT TESTING, enable IT to take proactive action against future performance problems.

      - See what’s inside all those mobile apps.

        With Aruba AppRF, AirWave provides deep visibility into performance and usage of mobile and web apps. Reputation reports allow you to quickly take action against high risk sites and control Wi-Fi usage by APP CATEGORY. User role, device type and location specific insights let you make quick decisions to protect business critical apps.

      - Watch Wi-Fi coverage on-demand.

        AirWave uses VisualRF to allow for TIME-LAPSE (縮時) MINING of Wi-Fi coverage – enabling wireless network engineers to RECORD AND REPLAY 24 hours of RF heat mapping.

        VisualRF also powers location specific, visual analytics on mobile and web app usage, mobile device performance, UC voice and video quality, and more.

      - Simplify management of multivendor networks.

        Get granular visibility across your entire access infrastructure and manage multiple generations of switching and wireless networks from just about any vendor.

## AppRF

  - [Aruba AppRF \- YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6kjPwNpNpA) -- 可以根據應用、裝置、使用者、時段、地點，將 Wi-Fi 資源做有效的分配。

      - The Home > AppRF pages display mobile app usage and performance on the network, and are available to network administrators only. This page is DISABLED BY DEFAULT. The option to enable this page is on the AMP Setup > General page under the Additional AMP Services section.

        其中 AMP 是 AirWare Management Platform 的縮寫。

        The Home > AppRF pages are renamed, starting with AirWave 8.0. In previous versions, they were named Home >Firewall.

        在 AirWave 8.2.9.1 發現又更名為 Traffic Analysis，但 URL 還是 `/apprf`。
