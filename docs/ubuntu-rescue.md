      - socratis: I take back my comment about "not early enough", you are pressing the Shift key "way too early"! :)

        Try it when the BIOS image is shown or right immediately after that, that's how I got my Ubuntu(s) and my Mint(s) to get into GRUB recovery mode. Yes, I do mean several of guests, any guest... BTW, I tried this on two MBPs...

        出現 BIOS 畫面時再按下 Shift。
