    What are roles and responsibilities?

      - Roles refer to one’s POSITION on a team. Responsibilities refer to the TASKS and DUTIES of their particular role or job description.

      - Employees are held accountable for completing several tasks in the workplace. The clearer their supervisor OUTLINES THE TASKS, the better employees can achieve their team’s goals and succeed in their individual roles at the company.

      - For a supervisor or team leader to effectively DELEGATE, however, they must understand that individual’s role at the company. It can also be beneficial to understand the benefits of implementing functional roles and responsibilities.

      - Hiring 的 Job Description (JD) 寫的有兩件事:

          - Qualification: 通常就是 Skills, 也就是必要的技能、職能，不管是軟技能、硬技能都在這裡，一般面試考試會問的技術範疇，重點在 #能事
          - Responsibilities: 描述主要的任務 (Mission)、目標、產出，重點在 #成事

      - 講清楚要會什麼 (Role)、做什麼 (Responsibility) 是很重要的，講不清楚 JD 就開不出來、或者亂開，然後就啥人都找不到，或者找到的都是高大上的
