      - Dev Automation is Here

        Rollbar automates the grunt-work of development so software teams can deploy more often

        除了 error tracking 還有其他功能 ?? 否則為何稱 Dev Automation?

      - Ops automation is 80% solved Dev automation is just beginning

        It’s pointless to deploy faster, if you don’t deploy often. We help companies increase their deployment frequency by 9x.

        Where is your software delivery process stuck?

    Get tests from red to green faster 為什麼 Rollbar 知道測試結果 ??

      - Diagnose and fix broken tests faster
      - Get real-time results and stack traces with LOCAL VARIABLES
      - Fix broken tests before the build finishes

    Get through QA faster

      - Never wonder how to repro a bug again
      - Reduce the back and forth between dev and QA
      - Dedupe bug reports and prioritize bugs affecting many test cases

    Iterate in production faster

      - Monitor errors in real-time
      - Only fix what matters
      - See exactly how and where the error occurred, and resolve within minutes
