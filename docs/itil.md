      - ITIL (formerly Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a set of DETAILED PRACTICES for IT activities such as IT service management (ITSM) and IT asset management (ITAM) that focus on aligning IT services with the NEEDS OF BUSINESS.

      - ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and CHECKLISTS which are neither organization-specific nor technology-specific, but can be applied by an organization toward strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of competency.

        It allows the organization to establish a BASELINE from which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate compliance and to MEASURE IMPROVEMENT.

      - The IT Service Desk is intended to be a primary point of ENGAGEMENT between users and an IT organization. According to the ITIL, the service desk is the single point of contact (SPOC) between the service provider (IT) and users for DAY-TO-DAY ACTIVITIES.

        A typical service desk manages incidents (service disruptions) and service requests (routine service related tasks) along with handling user communications for things like outages and planned changes to services. A service desk typically has a broad scope and is designed to provide the user with a single place to go for all their IT needs. This results in the service desk playing a pivotal role in FACILITATING the integration of business processes with the technology ecosystem and broader service management infrastructure.
