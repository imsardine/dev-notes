      - Private clouds are cloud environments solely dedicated to the end user, usually within the user’s firewall. Although private clouds TRADITIONALLY RAN ON-PREMISE, organizations are now building private clouds on rented, vendor-owned data centers LOCATED OFF-PREMISE.

        All clouds become private clouds when the underlying IT infrastructure is dedicated to a single customer with completely isolated access.

    How do private clouds work?

      - Private clouds rely on a handful of various technologies, but understanding how VIRTUALIZATION works is the key to understanding how private clouds work. A private cloud uses virtualization technology to combine resources sourced from physical hardware into SHARED POOLS. This way, the cloud doesn't have to create environments by virtualizing resources one at a time from a bunch of different physical systems. A scripted IT process can just grab all those resources from a single source—like a data supermarket.

      - Adding a layer of management software gives administrative control over the infrastructure, platforms, applications, and data that will be used in the cloud by helping cloud admins track and optimize use, oversee integration points, and retain or recover data. When the final automation layer is added to replace or reduce human interaction with repeatable instructions and processes, the self-service component of the cloud is complete and that bundle of technologies is now a private cloud.
