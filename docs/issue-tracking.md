# Issue Tracking

  - [Always start with an issue \| GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2016/03/03/start-with-an-issue/) #ril

      - “Always start with an issue” says Job, VP of Product here at GitLab. Before you begin anything else, summarize your ideas in an issue and share it. It’s such a simple rule, but the impact is huge.

      - In this post we'll focus on issues for feature proposals specifically, but the rule applies in any case, no matter what kind of project you're working on. We say “start” with an issue and not “create” an issue, because one might already exist. Make sure to search in All issues (open and closed) to see if your idea has been proposed already.

    GitLab is a discussion about software

      - The benefits of collaboration start at the point of making an issue. By making an issue, you get your ideas out there, and this allows your collaborators to have their say early in the process.

      - Non-programmers think that programmers are constantly tapping away at their keyboards on code. In fact software development is MORE LIKE A DISCUSSION, and it’s a more collaborative experience than it is a solitary one.

        The tools GitLab provides make it easier to manage that discussion, and KEEP THE FLOW OF CONVERSATION MOVING.
