    Methods

      - Methods for object detection generally fall into either MACHINE LEARNING-BASED approaches or DEEP LEARNING-BASED approaches.

        For Machine Learning approaches, it becomes necessary to first DEFINE FEATURES?? using one of the methods below, then using a technique such as SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) to do the CLASSIFICATION.

        On the other hand, deep learning techniques that are able to do END-TO-END object detection without specifically defining features, and are typically based on [convolutional neural networks (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_networks) (卷積神經網路).

      - Machine Learning approaches:

          - Viola–Jones object detection framework based on Haar features
          - Scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT)
          - Histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features

      - Deep Learning approaches:

          - Region Proposals (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN)
