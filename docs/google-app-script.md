  - [When to use AppSheet or Apps Script in Google Workspace \| Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/workspace-developers/when-to-use-appsheet-or-apps-script-in-google-workspace) (2020-10-21)

      - We recently announced Google Workspace, which seamlessly brings together messaging, meetings, docs, and tasks to help our customers create, communicate, and collaborate even more effectively. This includes the ability to EXTEND AND CUSTOMIZE PRODUCTIVITY in ways beyond Google Workspace, through AppSheet, Google Cloud’s NO-CODE development platform, and Apps Script, Google Workspace’s integrated LOW-CODE development platform.

        注意 low-code 與 no-code 的差別。AppSheet 是 Google 的產品? 為何沒有免費提供

      - The power of these platforms comes from their ability to let anyone—even people without coding backgrounds—customize their work. Whether that means building an app that your FIELD TEAM can use to track customer visits, a custom function in Sheets that performs a specific calculation, or even a macro that automates a repetitive task, with AppSheet and Apps Script, you can create these types of custom solutions more easily than ever.

      - AppSheet and Apps Script empower users to extend the power of Google Workspace by building business apps, workflows, and automations. AppSheet lets you build custom applications on top of Google Workspace applications, as well as all other services and applications in your environment, all without writing any code.

        Meanwhile, with just a few lines of code, Apps Script lets you EXTEND AND MODIFY THE BEHAVIOR of Google Workspace applications with customizations like Sheet functions, menu items, triggers, data validation, and more.

    How no-code extends Google Workspace

      - As a TRUE NO-CODE platform, AppSheet requires no coding experience to create and deploy an app or workflow, including those that leverage your favorite Google Workspace applications. Everything can be done using AppSheet’s UI, which includes natural language capabilities powered by machine learning as well as expressions that translate complex code into user-friendly forms, similar to Sheets formulas.

        Common use cases include FIELD SERVICE (現場服務) and data capture, transportation logistics, compliance reporting, delivery tracking, facilitation of property surveys, and much more.

      - AppSheet applications allow you to harness a broad range of data sources and functions. From data captured in custom applications and SQL databases to other sources including Google Maps and Google Workspace applications like Sheets, Drive, Docs, Calendar, and Meet.

        AppSheet offers a myriad of possibilities for creating business solutions and improving workflows. AppSheet applications are deployed as MOBILE AND WEB APPS and are therefore supported by your favorite browser, whether it be on your desktop, iOS or Android platforms, giving your teams the flexibility to use their everyday work devices.

## 新手上路 {: #getting-started }

  - [Your first script - Overview of Google Apps Script  \|  Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/overview#your_first_script)

      - Build and run a simple standalone script that creates a Google Doc and emails you a link to it.

    Set it up: To build the script, follow the steps below.

     1. Sign in to your Google Account.
     2. To open the script editor, go to script.google.com. If this is the first time you've been to script.google.com, click View Dashboard.
     3. At the top left, click New project.

     4. Delete any code in the script editor and paste in the code below.

            /**
             * Creates a Google Doc and sends an email to the current user with a link to the doc.
             */
            function createAndSendDocument() {
              // Create a new Google Doc named 'Hello, world!'
              var doc = DocumentApp.create('Hello, world!');

              // Access the body of the document, then add a paragraph.
              doc.getBody().appendParagraph('This document was created by Google Apps Script.');

              // Get the URL of the document.
              var url = doc.getUrl();

              // Get the email address of the active user - that's you.
              var email = Session.getActiveUser().getEmail();

              // Get the name of the document to use as an email subject line.
              var subject = doc.getName();

              // Append a new string to the "url" variable to use as an email body.
              var body = 'Link to your doc: ' + url;

              // Send yourself an email with a link to the document.
              GmailApp.sendEmail(email, subject, body);
            }

     5. At the top, click Save save.
     6. At the top left, click Untitled project.
     7. Enter a name for your script and click Rename.

    Try it out: To execute the script, follow the steps below.

     1. At the top of the editor, click Run.

     2. In the first dialog box that appears, click Review permissions. In the second dialog box, review the permissions your script uses and click Allow.

        按下 Review Permission 後有一堆授權限要處理：

          - Authorization required: This project requires your permission to access your data.
          - Choose an account to continue to Hello, World!

          - Google hasn’t verified this app: The app is requesting access to sensitive info in your Google Account. Until the developer (xxx@gmail.com) VERIFIES THIS APP WITH GOOGLE, you shouldn't use it.

          - Hello, World! wants to access your Google Account: This will allow Hello, World! to:

              - Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail
              - See, edit, create, and delete all your Google Docs documents

            因為用到 `DocumentApp` 跟 `GmailApp`，就會要求對應的權限。

     3. When the script execution completes, check your Gmail inbox for the new email.
     4. Open the email and click the link to open the Google Doc you created.
