      - Whether integrated with G Suite or THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS, Cloud Search helps your employees quickly, easily, and securely find information across the business. 這裡的 third-party application 是指??
      - Anything and everything at your fingertips -- Cloud Search makes available robust SDKs and ready-to-use APIs that let you scalably index vast amounts of data from any source. Cloud Search will also make available out-of-the-box connectors for indexing third-party databases like Oracle and MySQL, file systems like Windows file systems, intranet solutions like Microsoft SharePoint, and plugins for popular web crawlers like Nutch and Norconex.
