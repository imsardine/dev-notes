      - AVR is a family of microcontrollers developed since 1996 by Atmel, acquired by Microchip Technology in 2016.
      - AVR was one of the first microcontroller families to use on-chip flash memory for program storage, as opposed to one-time programmable ROM ... 方便更新程式
      - AVR microcontrollers find many applications as EMBEDDED SYSTEMS. They are especially common in hobbyist and educational embedded applications, popularized by their inclusion in many of the Arduino line of open hardware development boards. 這一點可以從 [Arduino Boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Environment#boards) 幾乎全部採用 ATmega* 得到印證。
