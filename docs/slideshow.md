# Slideshow

## Markdown

用 Markdown 製作 slides 的好處有：

  - 使用慣用的編輯器撰寫，比較能專注在內容。
  - 原始碼是純文字，方便做版本控制。
  - 輕鬆表現 code highlighting。

首推 [reveal.js](revealjs.md)。

    Why use it?

      - If your ideal slideshow creation workflow contains any of the following steps:

          - Just write what's on your mind
          - Do some basic styling
          - Easily collaborate with others
          - Share with and show to everyone

        Then remark might be perfect for your next* slideshow!

      - As the slideshow is expressed using Markdown, you may:

        FOCUS ON THE CONTENT, expressing yourself in next to plain text not worrying what flashy graphics and disturbing effects to put where

      - As the slideshow is actually an HTML document, you may:

          - Display it in any decent browser
          - Style it using regular CSS, just like any other HTML content
          - Use it offline!

      - As the slideshow is contained in a plain file, you may:

          - Store it wherever you like; on your computer, hosted from your Dropbox, hosted on Github Pages alongside the stuff you're presenting...
          - Easily collaborate with others, keeping track of changes using your favourite SCM tool, like Git or Mercurial

    3. Google Slides – Free online presentation maker

      - Google Docs has been around for a long time, and besides the great office features, it also lets you create and share presentations and MEDIA-RICH slides with whoever you want, whenever you want, totally free.

    5. Speaker Deck – Ads free Slideshare

      - This is a COMPLETELY FREE service that you can upload and share your presentations online. You have to upload the presentation file as a PDF and Speaker Deck splits your PDF into slides creating a beautiful slideshow.

        只能上傳 PDF 再拆解開來，是否意謂著沒有動態的效果? 但老實說，動態效果並不重要。

      - Presentations can be embedded on your website using the provided web embed code. You can also share the link on Facebook and Twitter. Your followers can view the easy to navigate presentation on Speakerdeck.com, more like Slideshare but without ads!

      - Limits: PDF version of the slideshow that you upload cannot be larger than 50 Megabytes and you can upload up to 500 presentations all time.

    8. Slides – Beautiful online presentation tool

      - The first third-party app on our list, and definitely not the last. Slides pride itself on a very user-friendly interface, which lets you create beautiful presentations using any kind of media, and share them with a single click.

      - The BASIC VERSION is free, but if you want more, you’ll need to sign up for a paid plan. If you want to quickly create modern slides that will catch people’s attention, this is a great tool to start with.

        可以先在本機做好上傳，只將 slides.com 做為分享的平台 (不想失去動態的效果)?
