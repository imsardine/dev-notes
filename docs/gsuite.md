    好像都跟 business 有關，GCP 跟 G Suite 的關係有點難分?

  - [About the name change from Google Apps to G Suite \- G Suite Admin Help](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7126147?hl=en)

      - We created Google Apps to help people everywhere work and innovate together, so organizations can move faster and achieve more. On September 29, 2016, we introduced a new name that better reflects this mission: G Suite.

        從下面 Editions/Products 的對照看來 Google Apps for Work Unlimited --> G Suite Business 與 Google Apps for Education --> G Suite for Education 看來，是把 G Suite Basic/Business 的前身是 Google Apps for Work，而其他 G Suite for XXX 則源自對應的 Google Apps for XXX，也就是 G Suite 不全然跟 business/enterprise 有關，重點是 "how people work together"。

      - For background about the change, see the [blog post](https://cloud.googleblog.com/2016/09/all-together-now-introducing-G-Suite.html). Also, Google for Work is now Google Cloud. See more in the [blog post](https://cloud.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-Google-Cloud.html).

  - [Official Google Cloud Blog: Introducing Google Cloud](https://cloud.googleblog.com/2016/09/introducing-Google-Cloud.html) (2016-09-29)

      - Google Cloud spans every layer of the BUSINESS, including all of Google Cloud Platform; our USER FACING collaboration and productivity applications — now named G Suite; all of our machine learning tools and APIs; the enterprise Maps APIs; and also the Android phones, tablets and Chromebooks that access the cloud. All this, built for the cloud from the get-go.

        看起來 Google Cloud 無所不包，但都圍遶著 business，也就是 Google Cloud = GCP + G Suite (user facing apps) + APIs + ML + ... 注意別把 Google Cloud 跟 Google Cloud Platform (GCP) 搞混了，G Suite 確實是 Google Cloud 的一員，但跟 GCP 是平行的關係。

      - Finally, in addition to introducing Google Cloud, we’re also announcing G Suite, our new name for Google Apps for Work. G Suite is a set of intelligent apps — Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Hangouts and more — designed to bring people together, with real-time collaboration capability built in from the start.
