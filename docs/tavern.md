  - [Easier API testing \| Tavern](https://taverntesting.github.io/)

      - Tavern is a PYTEST PLUGIN, command-line tool and Python library for automated testing of APIs, with a simple, concise and flexible YAML-BASED SYNTAX. It’s very simple to get started, and highly customisable for complex tests.

        所謂 pytest plugin 是指會自動找 `test_*.tavern.yaml` 來當 test case，但就 "highly customisable for complex tests" 這點我是存疑的，畢竟 Tavern 發展出一層專用的 DSL，所謂 "highly customisable for complex tests" 指的就是開發 Tavern plugin 吧?

      - Tavern supports testing RESTful APIs as well as MQTT based APIs.

      - The best way to use Tavern is with pytest. Tavern comes with a pytest plugin so that literally all you have to do is install pytest and Tavern, write your tests in `.tavern.yaml` files and run pytest. This means you get access to all of the pytest ecosystem and allows you to do all sorts of things like regularly run your tests against a test server and report failures or generate HTML reports.

      - You can also integrate Tavern into your own test framework or continuous integration setup using the Python library, or use the command line tool, `tavern-ci` with bash scripts and cron jobs. ??
