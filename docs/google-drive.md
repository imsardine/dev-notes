## Team Drive

      - Unlike files in My Drive, files in a Team Drive belong to the team instead of an individual. Even if members LEAVE, the files stay exactly where they are so your team can continue to share information and get work done. 暗指 My Drive 帳號刪除，檔案就跟著不見了?
      - Team Drives is only available with the G Suite Enterprise, Business, or Education editions. If you don't see Team Drives in Google Drive, it might not be available for your organization.
      - Not sure whether to use My Drive or Team Drives? 提到 If the files are for a variety of projects, create multiple Team Drives. ... 用 project 來分 drive 會不會太細了?

  - [What's the difference between My Drive and Team Drives? - FAQ - Google Drive \| Learning Center \| G Suite](https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/#!/faq) #ril
      - My Drive is best for storing personal files or files that you want to SHARE ONE-ON-ONE. Team Drives is best to use with a group of collaborators who are working on the same files. 這說法很容易懂!!

    Some key differences between My Drive and Team Drives are:

      - Who can add files? -- Any member with CONTRIBUTOR access or higher.
      - What types of files can I add? -- All file types (except Google Maps).
      - Who owns files and folders? -- The team.
      - Can I move files and folders?
          - If you have Contributor access or higher, you can move files from My Drive to a Team Drive. 把 My Drive 的檔案整理進 Team Drive 是很重要的一步!! 不過移動 folder 需要 admin 的幫忙?
          - If you have CONTENT MANAGER access or higher, you can move files and FOLDERS within a Team Drive. 由少數人規劃好檔案該怎麼放
          - If you have MANAGER access, you can move files out of a Team Drive or between Team Drives. 檔案可以在不同 team drive 間移動
          - If you want to move folders from My Drive to Team Drives, contact your G Suite admin.

      - Can I sync files to my computer? It depends on which sync solution you use: Drive File Stream: Yes Backup and Sync: No
      - How does sharing work? -- All members of the Team Drive see all files.
      - How long do files I delete stay in Trash? Each Team Drive has its own Trash. Members with CONTENT MANAGER access and above can move files to Trash. Files and folders in Trash are deleted forever after 30 days. Members with MANAGER access can permanently delete files BEFORE 30 days. 反應時間 30 天，不過一般人都可以 restore。
      - Can I restore files? -- Yes, if you have at least Contributor access.
