      - `Cmd-[/]` - 按 history 切換。
      - `Cmd-K` - 跳到輸入的 channel
  - How do I jump to a specific date in history or the oldest message in a Slack channel in the desktop app? - Stack Overflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35122312/ 用 Channel Settings > Jump to date ... 可以緩解這個問題，但要記住剛剛在哪個日期就是了。

## Mention ??

@here、@channel 跟 @everyone 有什麼不同?

  - [Make an announcement – Slack Help Center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement) `@here` 會通知到 active (相對於 away) 的人，適合用在 "currently working or available" 的人；而 `@channel`/`@everyone` 則不管是不是 active 都通知 (所以會提示多少人會被通知到、落在幾個時區)。另外 `@everyone` 是針對整個 workspace，通常只會用在 `#general`。

## 如何將未讀的訊息一次全部標示為已讀?

## Call, Screen Sharing ??

      - SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO TALK THINGS OUT. With Slack Calls, you can make a voice or video call with any member of your workspace.

        用講的比較快! 可以只開聲音? 不知道多人的效果如何? ==> 預設只會啟用聲音，多人效果還可以，通常是使用者端收音的問題 (不夠靠近 Mic)。

      - Need a shortcut for making calls? We've got a slash command for that! Use `/call` in a DM or channel to start a call.

    Start a call

      - On any plan, a member can start a call with one other member via a direct message (DM). To start a call from a group DM or a channel, a workspace must be on one of our paid plans. For calls with more than two people, there can be a total of 15 participants.

        一對一是免費的，多人則要付費，最多同時 15 人。在 channel 裡 Start a call 有辦法選人嗎? ==> Start a call 只是丟出一個 link，自由 join，後面建議自己用 mention 找人，在 Start a call 的前後都可以。

    Start a call > From a direct message

      - Open a direct message. Click the phone icon at the top right. Your call will start right away, and the member you're calling will receive a pop-up notification.
      - You can also click the camera icon to start a video call and even share your screen if your workspace is on a paid plan.

    Start a call > From a channel

      - Open a channel and click the phone icon at the top right. Confirm you'd like to start a call. Give the call a NAME if you'd like, then click Start new call. 其中 NAME 比較像是個 "討論的主題"，例如 "Let's finalize our Q3 goals!"
      - Your call will post to the channel and any member (up to 15 total) can join by clicking Join this call.
      - You can also click the camera icon to start a video call and even share your screen if your workspace is on a paid plan. 多人的畫筆、滑鼠控制會變怎樣?? ==> 可以同時畫，但畫筆顏色不同
      - Use an `@here` or `@channel` mention to notify channel members BEFORE OR AFTER you start the call.

    Share and invite others to a call

      - Invite other members to a call -- To invite a specific member to join your current call, follow these steps: Click the plus icon in the upper-right corner of the call window. Start typing a member's name to filter the list. Select a member to invite.
      - Share a call in a channel -- If you'd like to share a call in other channels, here's how: Click the  plus icon in the upper-right corner of the call window. Click Share this call. Join a call > Answer a direct message call

    Join a call > Join a channel call

      - Click Join this call from the in-channel invitation. A call window will open where you can see who else is on the call, and WHO IS SPEAKING.

        可以控制誰能發言??
