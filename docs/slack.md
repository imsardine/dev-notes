@here、@channel 跟 @everyone 有什麼不同?

  - [Make an announcement – Slack Help Center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/202009646-Make-an-announcement) `@here` 會通知到 active (相對於 away) 的人，適合用在 "currently working or available" 的人；而 `@channel`/`@everyone` 則不管是不是 active 都通知 (所以會提示多少人會被通知到、落在幾個時區)。另外 `@everyone` 是針對整個 workspace，通常只會用在 `#general`。

## Huddle

  - [Start a huddle in a channel or direct message \| Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/4402059015315-Start-a-huddle-in-a-channel-or-direct-message)

      - Recreate the QUICK, INFORMAL discussions you’d have in the office right in Slack. You can start a huddle in any channel or direct message (DM), invite specific people to join, and share your screen to work side-by-side with your team.

    What to expect

      - Slack Huddles can have up to 50 participants, and anyone in a conversation can join a huddle once it starts. When a huddle starts in a DM, all members will RECEIVE AN INVITATION.

        在 channel 裡啟用 huddle 不會主動通知。

      - When you join a huddle from Slack on desktop, you can share your screen and turn on LIVE CAPTIONS. Captions in huddles are only available in English, but we plan to offer more languages in the future.
      - In Slack Connect channels and DMs, people from other organizations must have access to huddles in order to start or join them.
      - Security policies for Slack calls also apply to huddles.

    Start a huddle (Desktop)

      - Open a channel or DM.
      - Click the headphones toggle in the bottom left corner of your sidebar or press Cmd+Shift+H (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+H (Windows/Linux).

      - Once the huddle has started, you can click the microphone icon to mute your microphone, the screen icon to share your screen, or the add people icon to invite specific people to the huddle.

        Tip: You can invite people to huddles in group DMs or channels they’re not a part of. They’ll be able to join your huddle, but will not be able to access the content in the conversation or see the name of a private channel.

        這點倒是滿方便的!!

      - To turn on live captioning, click the name of the person actively talking in the bottom left corner of your screen. Click the three dots icon, then select Turn on captions.

    Leave a huddle (Desktop)

      - Anyone can leave a huddle at any time, including the person who started it. A huddle will AUTOMATICALLY END when the last person leaves.

        若部門成員可以養成習慣回到座位就加入 Huddle，可以營造出大家就坐在旁邊的氛圍。

    Start a live audio conversation with the right experts to quickly resolve customer support tickets

      - Before, you could swivel your chair and tap a colleague or supervisor for help if a customer support ticket had you particularly stumped. But in the remote and hybrid workplace, tracking down the right person for help can become an unexpected time sink.

        Slack Huddles, a lightweight AUDIO-FIRST way to start live conversations, re-creates the quick, informal CHATS YOU’D HAVE IN THE OFFICE, right in Slack.

      - If you need help resolving a customer support ticket, you can fire up a huddle with the right product expert or stakeholder in any DM or Slack channel, a digital space to share messages, tools and files. You can also start a huddle in the channels you share with partners outside your company.

      - From a triage, escalation or swarm channel, you can move from an ASYNCHRONOUS CONVERSATION to a live audio discussion in seconds. Bring together the right people at the right time in a single huddle, and even share your screen to talk through a specific case in detail.

        用講的比較快，若需要開 issue 再請使用者開。

      - Slack Huddles offer agents?? immediate access to the CROSS-FUNCTIONAL SUPPORT they need. As a result, agents are able to maintain OWNERSHIP of their cases, which positively impacts the customer experience by limiting handoffs. With Slack, service teams experience an overall 17.4% average REDUCTION IN ESCALATIONS and 11% average increase in customer satisfaction scores (CSAT).

        減少 escalation 是因為透過 Huddle 溝通就解掉了?

  - [What Is Slack Huddles and How Can You Try It for Yourself?](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-slack-huddles/) (2021-07-27)

      - With the COVID-19 global pandemic, more people than ever have begun to work from home, and a surge of new digital solutions have emerged to meet these new demands.

        Slack, however, is not one of these new solutions. Created in 2013, Slack has been helping businesses big and small to communicate digitally for almost eight years, and its newest feature called Slack huddles is looking to take this to the next level.

    What Is Slack huddles?

      - Slack huddles is an audio-only call feature that aims to bring the spontaneous and informal nature of IN-PERSON OFFICE COMMUNICATION to the digital realm.

        有別於正式的 meeting。

      - Getting started with Slack has always been easy, and its huddles feature is no exception. By simply clicking the headphone toggle in the bottom-left of the Slack screen you can create a Slack huddle in any channel or even in a direct message with one of your co-workers.
      - Once in, you can create an invite to send to those you want to join or WAIT FOR PEOPLE TO POP IN of their own accord. You’ll be able to hear each other’s voices without the PRESSURE TO SPRUCE UP for the camera, and you can even share your screen if the need arises.

      - Once in, you and your co-workers will be able to drop in and out like in any NATURAL CONVERSATION. The goal here is to emulate the FEELING OF BEING IN A REAL OFFICE SPACE where you can drop by one another's desk to hash out details WITHOUT HAVING TO SCHEDULE TIME FOR A MEETING.

        As such, the huddle LASTS FOR AS LONG AS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN IT, meaning you can start up a chat while you drink your coffee and then leave it when you’re finished without having to worry about disrupting the conversation for others.

      - Slack huddles can support up to 50 people. It even features captioning of what you and your co-workers are saying for those who want it. Currently, this feature only works in English, but Slack has plans to offer a wider range of languages in the future.

    ---

    What Else Does Slack Have to Offer?

      - Slack huddles isn’t the only new feature being rolled out to make working from home easier. Slack has also announced two new features that will release worldwide to further its efficiency.

    Asynchronous Video, Voice, and Screen Recordings

      - Don’t worry if that sounds complicated. This is a simple feature that can have a big impact on how you communicate digitally at work.

        Finding a time that works for everyone can be pretty difficult, especially when your team members are working across multiple time zones or on different schedules.

      - Slack has an alternative where anyone can make recordings that can be sent and viewed anytime. You can use these recordings creatively: make SHORT PITCHES, make brief conversations more personal, or even DEMONSTRATE A PROBLEM VISUALLY.

        錄製的標的可以是整個 screen 或個別 app。

      - To support this feature, Slack has added expanded playback features for these recordings and THIRD-PARTY?? videos. You will now be able to speed up and slow down content, read transcripts, and view them from the phone when on the move.

        Like with Slack huddles, live captions are available for them as well. As with huddles, only English is currently supported, with more language options to follow.

    Scheduled Messaging

      - As the name implies, scheduled messaging will allow you to choose exactly when you want your messages to be sent. This feature is a standard with most email service providers, but it's being introduced on services like Slack and Discord.

      - A wider range of messaging options fit into different work scenarios. With the facility to send messages at scheduled times, you will be able to AUTOMATE DIGITAL MEETINGS. Just record your idea, pitch, or thoughts at your own convenience, and then set the message to be sent AT THE MEETING’S START.

  - [Solve problems aloud with Slack huddles \| Slack](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/resources/using-slack/solve-problems-aloud-with-slack-huddles)

      - Be it brainstorming ideas, solving TIME-SENSITIVE ISSUES or catching up after a long weekend, sometimes it’s EASIER TO TALK THINGS THROUGH. Slack huddles are there to do just that, right from where you’re already working.

      - Slack huddles are a lightweight and AUDIO-FIRST way to communicate inside a Slack channel or direct message, including those with external partners. And perhaps more practically, they’re a DIGITAL-FIRST way to MIMIC the fast, informal discussions THAT TOOK PLACE WHEN EVERYONE WORKED FROM THE OFFICE: swinging by a colleague’s desk with a question, pulling a few people aside after a meeting or just catching up with whomever you ran into at the proverbial watercooler.

      - When a huddle is OPEN, any member of the channel or DM can come and go as they please. Anyone present can share their screen, and OTHERS CAN DRAW ON IT. There’s also an option for live captioning.

      - We’re seeing customers lean on huddles to swarm incidents, host one-to-one conversations without the burden of video and even take VIRTUAL GROUP COFFEE BREAKS. To help your team make the most of this new tool, let’s go through six scenarios where huddles come in handy for our team at Slack.

        The key message to take away: IF TALKING SOMETHING THROUGH IS FASTER THAN TYPING IT OUT, YOU’LL WANT TO START A HUDDLE. 用講的比較快

    1. Conduct open-office hours in any channel

      - Many managers and directors have historically had an OPEN-DOOR POLICY, and in this new digital-first world, that often manifests as an AGENDA-FREE TIME SLOT on their calendars where anyone with the associated video-call link can log on to discuss whatever is on their mind. Huddles are a more inclusive alternative.

      - We’ve seen leaders create a huddle in a team’s channel – often on a regular schedule, such as 14:00 to 15:00 every Friday – where anyone in the channel is welcome to join.

        Channels with ACTIVE huddles are marked as such in your sidebar??, offering a subtle indicator to others that they can drop in. Members of the channel can also see who’s in the huddle and OPT TO listen in if they think that the context might be helpful.

    2. Brainstorm sessions after meetings

      - Let’s say that you just stepped out of a company all-hands meeting focused on next quarter’s future plans. You likely have a list of action items for your own team, and creating a quick huddle is a CASUAL way to get everyone up to speed while the key messages and goals are still fresh.

        Slack huddles support screen sharing, so a manager can pull up a spreadsheet or document to log ideas or a calendar to discuss timelines.

    3. Quick and lightweight pair programming

      - Pair programming is the common name for when two or more people work on a single piece of code together. Screen sharing is key to making this work. Say someone is stuck on a technical problem. It’s one that the team hasn’t faced before, so searching Slack for the answer isn’t an option.

        Instead, the engineer can post a request for help in-channel and then open a huddle. Others can join in to lend a hand, and use the drawing feature to circle areas on the screen that might be the sources of any issues as they all talk it through.

    4. Addressing eleventh-hour stakeholder feedback

      - When big releases and launches were managed from the office, it was common to stake out a conference table and declare it your team’s ‘war room’, a dedicated place for everyone to set up shop and take a project over the finishing line.

        Slack huddles can fill a similar role for distributed teams. Open a LAUNCH-DAY HUDDLE in your team’s channel and let anyone use it to address last bits of feedback that roll in, as well as to coordinate your run-of-show checklist for the big day.

    5. Weekly clean-ups to tie up loose ends

      - At Slack, many managers come together in huddles each week to update their TRELLO BOARDS, product roadmaps and Jira queues.

        These huddles often REPLACE A REGULARLY SCHEDULED MEETING and become a dedicated space for the group to talk through stalled tasks or dangling bugs and ensure that project-management apps reflect the most accurate project statuses.

        本質上還是 meeting 不是?

    6. Social get-togethers

      - Slack huddles are audio-only, which can lower people’s STRESS levels around READING FACES AND BODY LANGUAGE, and reduce the FATIGUE associated with always being on camera.

        You can join and leave a huddle without losing the call, and we’ve seen teams adopt them for social hangouts, team lunches and even casual happy hours. An added bonus: you can talk with one another and take the occasional bite of food without any of your peers watching you chew.

      - Slack huddles are gradually rolling out to all Slack customers on paid subscriptions. The next time you need to PROBLEM-SOLVE AS A GROUP, or simply want to chat freely without the burden of video, give it a try. Found your own preferred reason to hop into a huddle?

  - [Make calls in Slack – Slack Help Center](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/216771908-Make-calls-in-Slack)

      - SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO TALK THINGS OUT. With Slack Calls, you can make a voice or video call with any member of your workspace.

        用講的比較快! 可以只開聲音? 不知道多人的效果如何? ==> 預設只會啟用聲音，多人效果還可以，通常是使用者端收音的問題 (不夠靠近 Mic)。

      - Need a shortcut for making calls? We've got a slash command for that! Use `/call` in a DM or channel to start a call.

    Start a call

      - On any plan, a member can start a call with one other member via a direct message (DM). To start a call from a group DM or a channel, a workspace must be on one of our paid plans. For calls with more than two people, there can be a total of 15 participants.

        一對一是免費的，多人則要付費，最多同時 15 人。在 channel 裡 Start a call 有辦法選人嗎? ==> Start a call 只是丟出一個 link，自由 join，後面建議自己用 mention 找人，在 Start a call 的前後都可以。

    Start a call > From a direct message

      - Open a direct message. Click the phone icon at the top right. Your call will start right away, and the member you're calling will receive a pop-up notification.
      - You can also click the camera icon to start a video call and even share your screen if your workspace is on a paid plan.

    Start a call > From a channel

      - Open a channel and click the phone icon at the top right. Confirm you'd like to start a call. Give the call a NAME if you'd like, then click Start new call. 其中 NAME 比較像是個 "討論的主題"，例如 "Let's finalize our Q3 goals!"
      - Your call will post to the channel and any member (up to 15 total) can join by clicking Join this call.
      - You can also click the camera icon to start a video call and even share your screen if your workspace is on a paid plan. 多人的畫筆、滑鼠控制會變怎樣?? ==> 可以同時畫，但畫筆顏色不同
      - Use an `@here` or `@channel` mention to notify channel members BEFORE OR AFTER you start the call.

    Share and invite others to a call

      - Invite other members to a call -- To invite a specific member to join your current call, follow these steps: Click the plus icon in the upper-right corner of the call window. Start typing a member's name to filter the list. Select a member to invite.
      - Share a call in a channel -- If you'd like to share a call in other channels, here's how: Click the  plus icon in the upper-right corner of the call window. Click Share this call. Join a call > Answer a direct message call

    Join a call > Join a channel call

      - Click Join this call from the in-channel invitation. A call window will open where you can see who else is on the call, and WHO IS SPEAKING.

        可以控制誰能發言??

## 安裝設置 {: #setup }

  - Slack 官方除提供 `.deb` 與 `.rpm` 外，也提供了 [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/slack)，因此其他 Linux distro 可以透過 [Snapcrapt](snapcraft.md) 安裝 Slack。

參考資料：

  - [Linux \| Downloads \| Slack](https://slack.com/downloads/linux)

      - 除 `.deb` (64-bit) 跟 `.rpm` (64-bit) 外，還有 Download from the Snap store?
      - [Install Slack for Linux using the Snap Store \| Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/slack) Users by distribution (log) 可以看出 Linux distro. + Snap + Slack 的排名，前面幾名都是 Ubuntu，接著才是 Linux Mint、Fedora 等。

  - [In a Snap, Slack Comes to Linux\. Here's How To Install It](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/in-a-snap-slack-comes-to-linux-heres-how-to-install-it/) (2018-01-19)
      - While binaries for Slack have been available for Ubuntu and Fedora, other Linux operating systems are not so lucky. To overcome this, Canonical has RELEASED SLACK AS A SNAP, which allows Slack to be installed and used on a greater variety of Linux distributions.

      - Snapcraft is a command line tool that allows you to install CONTAINERISED APPLICATIONS called SNAPS on many different Linux distribution. As these Snap containers contain all the required dependencies that a program needs to run, it makes it very easy to create and distribute a single container that works on a variety of Linux versions.

        雖然是 container，發現它跟其他應用程式融合得滿好的，剪貼簿換資料、拖放檔案等都沒有問題。

      - The creation of a Slack Snap is smart move by both the Slack team and Canonical. For Canonical, it provides a greater user base for their Snapcraft service and for Slack, it allows a larger audience to use their service and make upgrading to new Slack versions much easier. According to Jamie Bennett, VP of Engineering, Devices & IoT at Canonical:

        > Slack is helping to transform the modern workplace, and we’re thrilled to welcome them to the snaps ecosystem Today’s announcement is yet another example of PUTTING THE LINUX USER FIRST – Slack’s developers will now be able to push out the latest features straight to the user. By prioritising usability, and with the popularity of open source continuing to grow, the number of snaps is only set to rise in 2018.

    How to install Slack as a Snap

      - Now that we know that Slack is available as a Snap, the next thing we need to do is install it. Installing SNAPCRAFT, the program required to install and run Snaps, is really easy and supported on the Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Linux Mint, Manjaro, OpenEmbedded/Yocto, openSUSE, OpenWrt, Solus, & Ubuntu distributions.

      - Simply go to this page and follow the instructions on how to install the Snapcraft snapd service for your Linux distribution.  For example, on Ubuntu you can install Snapcraft simply by using these commands from a terminal: 為什麼 Ubuntu 上也要裝 Snap，Slack 官方不是已經提供有 Ubuntu 與 Fedora 的版本

            sudo apt update
            sudo apt install snapd

      - Once snapd is installed, you can then install Slack using these commands: (注意 `--classic` 的用法)

            sudo snap find slack
            sudo snap install slack --classic

      - Once slack is installed, you can launch your desktop and execute the `slack` command from a terminal. Slack will then start and you can use it as normal.

        美中不足的是要下指令，如何讓它出現在選單裡??
