      - Many times I felt that there was a BIG GAP between the IT departments that implemented new, innovative software and the business units that were meant to use it and that so much POTENTIAL was unrealized due to POOR ADOPTION and INEFFECTIVE USAGE.

        Therefore, in 2011 I resigned from Microsoft and founded Business Productivity. Our mission is to help customers increase the return on investment in productivity software by helping end users adopt technology and use it more effectively.

        We help bridge the gap between business and technology and we work closely with IT organizations and business users to jointly get the most value of the investments that have been made in productivity software.

        To train employees we produce short, real-life training videos that organizations can publish in their Intranet for today’s “YOUTUBE-SAVVY” EMPLOYEES. We also provide online courses on real-life business use of Microsoft productivity software for any business professional who wants to WORK SMARTER as well as customized videos on any other type of end-user software.
