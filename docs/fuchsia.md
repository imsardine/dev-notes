# Fuchsia

  - Fuchsia 唸做 [‵fjuʃə]，意思是 "吊鐘花"；早期 Fuchsia 的 log 真的是吊鐘花，後來雖然改成兩個拼接起來像無限的符號，但顏色仍採用 [fuchsia-colored](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Google_fuchsia3.svg)。

      - It’s no secret that Google is working on a third operating system that might someday replace BOTH ANDROID AND CHROME. Called Fuchsia, the new OS would solve the problem of Android fragmentation while simultaneously allowing Google to run it on a bunch of different types of devices, from smartphones to tablets and COMPUTERS, but also smart home gadgets, smartwatches, and other gadgets.

        Fuchsia is expected to run Android apps so that the transition from Android would happen almost seamlessly. 一個 OS 通吃所有大大小小的設備，還考量到 Android 平轉。
