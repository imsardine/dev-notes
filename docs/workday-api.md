    Recommendations

      - Workday Web Services (WWS) API

        This Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) API supports several thousand Workday operations. The API provides programmatic access to most Workday functionality through exchange of XML documents.

        Advantages:

          - API provides access to Workday data from outside of Workday.
          - API supports ALMOST ALL operations available in Workday.
          - Enables you to use developers trained on non-Workday development tools.
          - Enables you to use any development tool.

      - Workday REST API

        This API provides access to a LIMITED number of Workday operations. 很意外地，REST API 能做的事比 SOA 少!

        Advantages:

          - API provides access to a limited set of Workday operations from external applications.
          - API is lighter-weight than WWS API.
          - Enables you to use developers trained on non-Workday development tools.
          - Enables you to use any development tool.

    Limitations

      - Workday Web Services (WWS) API

        Requires external development expertise and infrastructure.

      - Workday REST API
