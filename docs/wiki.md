# Wiki

  - [Wiki \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki) #ril

      - A wiki (/ˈwɪki/) is a KNOWLEDGE BASE website on which users collaboratively modify and structure content directly from a web browser. In a typical wiki, text is written using a SIMPLIFIED MARKUP LANGUAGE and often edited with the help of a rich-text editor.

      - A wiki is run using wiki software, otherwise known as a wiki engine. A wiki engine is a type of content management system, but it differs from most other such systems, including blog software, in that the content is created WITHOUT ANY DEFINED OWNER or leader, and wikis have LITTLE INHERENT STRUCTURE, allowing structure to EMERGE ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE USERS.

      - There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are open source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Other rules may be imposed to ORGANIZE CONTENT.

    Characteristics

      - Ward Cunningham and co-author Bo Leuf, in their book The Wiki Way: Quick Collaboration on the Web, described the essence of the Wiki concept as follows:

          - A wiki invites ALL USERS—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki Web site, using only a standard "plain-vanilla" Web browser without any extra add-ons.
          - Wiki promotes MEANINGFUL TOPIC ASSOCIATIONS between different pages by making PAGE LINK CREATION INTUITIVELY EASY and showing whether an intended target page exists or not.
          - A wiki is not a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers, and designed for casual visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ONGOING PROCESS OF CREATION and COLLABORATION that constantly changes the website landscape.

      - A wiki enables communities of editors and contributors to write documents collaboratively. All that people require to contribute is a computer, Internet access, a web browser, and a basic understanding of a simple markup language (e.g., HTML).

        A single page in a wiki website is referred to as a "WIKI PAGE", while the entire collection of pages, which are usually WELL-INTERCONNECTED by hyperlinks, is "the wiki".

        A wiki is essentially a database for creating, browsing, and searching through information. A wiki allows NON-LINEAR, evolving, complex, and NETWORKED text, while also allowing for editor argument, debate, and interaction regarding the content and formatting.

      - A defining characteristic of wiki technology is the EASE with which pages can be created and updated. Generally, there is no review by a MODERATOR or GATEKEEPER before modifications are accepted and thus lead to changes on the website.

        Many wikis are open to alteration by the general public without requiring registration of user accounts. Many edits can be made in real-time and appear almost instantly online, but this feature facilitates ABUSE of the system.

        在企業內推動 Wiki，完全沒有 mederator/gatekeeper 可能會讓內容變得雜亂無章；或許任何的修改都不需要審核，但事後要有人幫忙調整。

      - Private wiki servers require user authentication to edit pages, and sometimes even to read them.

        Maged N. Kamel Boulos, Cito Maramba, and Steve Wheeler write that the open wikis produce a process of Social Darwinism. "'Unfit' sentences and sections are ruthlessly culled, edited, and replaced if they are not considered 'fit', which hopefully results in the evolution of a higher quality and more relevant page. While such openness may invite 'vandalism' and the posting of untrue information, this same openness also makes it possible to rapidly correct or restore a 'quality' wiki page." ??

## Orphan Links??

      - In the Wikipedia glossary, an orphan is defined as "an article with no links from other pages in the MAIN ARTICLE NAMESPACE". These pages can still be found by searching Wikipedia, but it is preferable that they can also be reachable by links from related pages; it is therefore helpful to add links from other suitable pages with similar and/or related information.

        DE-ORPHANING articles is an important aspect of building the web.
