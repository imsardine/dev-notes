# ITSM (IT Service Management)

  - [IT service management \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_service_management) #ril

      - Information technology service management (ITSM) are the activities that are performed by an organization to design, build, deliver, operate and control information technology (IT) services offered to customers.

      - Differing from more TECHNOLOGY-ORIENTED IT management approaches like network management and IT systems management, IT SERVICE management is characterized by adopting a process approach towards management, focusing on customer needs and IT services for customers rather than IT systems, and stressing CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT.

        The CIO WaterCoolers' annual ITSM report states that business uses ITSM "mostly in support of customer experience (35%) and service quality (48%)."

    Context

      - As a DISCIPLINE, ITSM has ties and common interests with other IT and general management approaches, information security management and software engineering.

        Consequently, IT service management frameworks have been influenced by other standards and adopted concepts from them, e.g. CMMI, ISO 9000, or ISO/IEC 27000.

        但 ITSM/ITIL 好像較少提到 security??

    Professional organizations

      - There are international, chapter-based (分會) professional associations, such as the IT Service Management Forum (itSMF), and HDI.

        The main goal of these organizations is to foster the exchange of experiences and ideas between users of ITSM frameworks. To this end, national and local itSMF and HDI chapters (LIGs or local interest groups for itSMF) organize conferences and workshops.

      - Some of them also contribute to the translations of ITSM framework documents into their respective languages or publish own ITSM guides. There are several certifications for service management like ITIL 2011 foundation.

    ITIL

      - IT service management is often EQUATED with ITIL, even though there are a variety of standards and frameworks contributing to the overall ITSM DISCIPLINE.

        ITIL originated as an official publication of United Kingdom government agencies (first CCTA, later OGC, then the Cabinet Office). In January 2014, ownership of ITIL was transferred to Axelos, a joint venture of the UK government and Capita, an international business process outsourcing and professional services company.

      - The ITIL 4 Foundation Book was released on February 18, 2019. In its former version (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of FIVE CORE VOLUMES, each of which covers a different ITSM LIFECYCLE STAGE.

    Other frameworks

      - Other frameworks for ITSM and OVERLAPPING DISCIPLINES include

      - Business Process Framework (eTOM) is a process framework for telecommunications service providers.

      - COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies) is an IT Governance framework that specifies control objectives, metrics and maturity models. Recent versions have aligned the naming of select control objectives to established ITSM process names.

      - FitSMis a standard for LIGHTWEIGHT service management. It contains several parts, including e.g. auditable requirements and document templates, which are published under Creative Common licenses. Its basic process framework is in large parts aligned to that of ISO/IEC 20000.

      - ISO/IEC 20000 is an international standard for managing and delivering IT services. Its process model bears many similarities to that of ITIL version 2, since BS 15000 (precursor of ISO/IEC 20000) and ITIL were mutually aligned up to version 2 of ITIL.

        ISO/IEC 20000 defines minimum requirements for an effective "service management system" (SMS). Conformance of the SMS to ISO/IEC can be audited and organizations can achieve an ISO/IEC 20000 certification of their SMS for a defined scope.

      - MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework) includes, in addition to a general framework of service management functions, guidance on managing services based on Microsoft technologies.

    Tools

      - Execution of ITSM processes in an organization, especially those processes that are more WORKFLOW-DRIVEN ones, can benefit significantly from being supported with specialized software tools.

        ITSM tools are often marketed as ITSM suites, which support a whole set of ITSM processes. At their core is usually a workflow management system for handling INCIDENTS, SERVICE REQUESTS, PROBLEMS and CHANGES.

      - They usually also include a tool for a CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT DATABASE. The ability of these suites to enable EASY LINKING between incident, service request, problem and change records with each other and with records of configuration items from the CMDB, can be a great advantage.

      - ITSM tools are also commonly referred to as ITIL tools. More than 100 tools are self-proclaimed ITSM or ITIL tools.

        Software vendors whose ITSM tools fulfill defined functional requirements to support a set of ITIL processes, can obtain official approval, allowing them to use Axelos trademarks and an "ITIL process compliant" logo, under Axelos' ITIL Software Endorsement scheme.

    Service Desk

      - A Service Desk is a PRIMARY IT function within the discipline of IT service management (ITSM) as defined by ITIL.

        有趣的是，這一節沒再提到 ITSM，講的都是 ITIL。

        It is intended to provide a SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT ("SPOC") to meet the communication needs of both users and IT staff, and also to satisfy both Customer and IT Provider objectives. "User" refers to the actual user of the service, while "Customer" refers to the entity that is PAYING FOR SERVICE.

      - The ITIL approach considers the service desk to be the CENTRAL point of contact between service providers and users/customers on a day-to-day basis. It is also a focal point for reporting incidents (disruptions or potential disruptions in service availability or quality) and for users making service requests (routine requests for services).

      - ITIL regards a call centre, contact centre or a help desk as LIMITED kinds of service desk which provide only a portion of what a service desk can offer.

        A service desk has a more broad and user-centered approach which is designed to provide the user with an INFORMED single point of contact for all IT requirements. A service desk seeks to facilitate the integration of business processes into the service management INFRASTRUCTURE.

      - In addition to ACTIVELY monitoring and OWNING incidents and user questions, and providing the communications channel for other service management disciplines with the user community, a service desk also provides an interface for other activities such as customer change requests, third parties (e.g. maintenance contracts), and software licensing.

      - Hi I'm Sarah from SysAid, we make ITSM software. Do you know what that means? We found that new employees joining the company had a hard time grasping the concept of what is ITSM. So we made this short video for them and we thought it'd be beneficial for all of you too.

        In the next few minutes we'll get you familiarized with two important terms ITSM and ITIL. Ready? Let's go

      - IT service management or ITSM for short is the term that refers to implementing, managing and delivering quality IT services in the best possible way to meet the needs of a business.

        It ensures the appropriate mix of people processes and technology are in place to provide value to a business.

      - Let me show you what that means in the real world. Think of a computer running ...

## ITSM vs. ITIL {: #itsm-vs-itil }

  - [What is ITSM? A guide to IT service management \| Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)

      - ITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on PRACTICES for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help organizations adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.

        ITIL 的重點是 practices (ITSM 的最佳實務) 而非 business，因為 business 本來就是 ITSM 重視的。

        ITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business and customer-value frame of reference, and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.

      - ITIL is sometimes misrepresented as “the rules,” rather than GUIDANCE, that is open for interpretation. Yet, just because we need to use process and document work, doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.”

    The Relationship Between ITSM and ITIL

      - ITSM and ITIL have a symbolic relationship. ITIL embodies everything in the ITSM definition. It provides GUIDANCE ON HOW TO WORK EFFECTIVELY, while ITSM is the way IT manages the delivery of services to business users.

    The Differences Between ITSM and ITIL

      - The differences between ITSM and ITIL include the following:

         1. ITIL is one of several frameworks that teaches the best practices to implement ITSM while ITSM is combining the use of that framework aligned with the various business perspectives to deliver quality IT services.

         2. ITIL is MICRO focused (微觀) internally to IT and ITSM is MACRO focused (宏觀) to the business.

         3. ITSM describes the "what", while ITIL describes the "how."

         4. ITSM is a set of methodologies that are applied to manage the services provided to the end user whereas ITIL is the BEST PRACTICE FRAMEWORK of ITSM. It helps in providing the necessary tools and techniques to provide those services effectively.

         5. ITSM is an overall ORGANIZATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION whereas ITIL is a collection of PROCESS STANDARDS that guide the delivery and support of IT services.

    Other ITSM frameworks

      - In addition to ITIL, the following are other ITSM frameworks:

         1. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)
         2. FitSM
         3. MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework)
         4. Agile and DevOps
         5. Lean
