## ITSM vs. ITIL {: #itsm-vs-itil }

  - [What is ITSM? A guide to IT service management \| Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/itsm)

      - ITIL is the most widely accepted approach to ITSM. ITIL focuses on PRACTICES for aligning IT services with business needs. ITIL can help organizations adapt to ongoing transformation and scale.

        ITIL 的重點是 practices (ITSM 的最佳實務) 而非 business，因為 business 本來就是 ITSM 重視的。

        ITIL 4, the recent update to ITIL standards, represents a paradigm shift for IT teams. It guides teams to a holistic, business and customer-value frame of reference, and encourages a more flexible approach based on how your team works. The ITIL 4 Guiding Principles promote collaboration, simplicity, and feedback.

      - ITIL is sometimes misrepresented as “the rules,” rather than GUIDANCE, that is open for interpretation. Yet, just because we need to use process and document work, doesn’t mean we should generate cumbersome masses of records and bureaucratic overhead. There is no excuse for hiding behind processes or the ITIL “rules.”

    The Relationship Between ITSM and ITIL

      - ITSM and ITIL have a symbolic relationship. ITIL embodies everything in the ITSM definition. It provides GUIDANCE ON HOW TO WORK EFFECTIVELY, while ITSM is the way IT manages the delivery of services to business users.

    The Differences Between ITSM and ITIL

      - The differences between ITSM and ITIL include the following:

         1. ITIL is one of several frameworks that teaches the best practices to implement ITSM while ITSM is combining the use of that framework aligned with the various business perspectives to deliver quality IT services.

         2. ITIL is MICRO focused (微觀) internally to IT and ITSM is MACRO focused (宏觀) to the business.

         3. ITSM describes the "what", while ITIL describes the "how."

         4. ITSM is a set of methodologies that are applied to manage the services provided to the end user whereas ITIL is the BEST PRACTICE FRAMEWORK of ITSM. It helps in providing the necessary tools and techniques to provide those services effectively.

         5. ITSM is an overall ORGANIZATIONAL IMPLEMENTATION whereas ITIL is a collection of PROCESS STANDARDS that guide the delivery and support of IT services.

    Other ITSM frameworks

      - In addition to ITIL, the following are other ITSM frameworks:

         1. COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies)
         2. FitSM
         3. MOF (Microsoft Operations Framework)
         4. Agile and DevOps
         5. Lean
