# Multitenancy

  - [Multitenancy \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multitenancy) #ril

      - The term "software multitenancy" refers to a software architecture in which a SINGLE INSTANCE of software runs on a server and serves MULTIPLE TENANTS. Systems designed in such manner are often called shared (in contrast to dedicated or isolated).

        A tenant is a group of users who share a common access with specific privileges to the software instance. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to provide every tenant a DEDICATED SHARE of the instance - including its data, configuration, user management, tenant individual functionality and non-functional properties.

      - Multitenancy contrasts with MULTI-INSTANCE architectures, where separate software instances operate on behalf of different tenants.

        Some commentators regard multitenancy as an important feature of cloud computing.[2][3]
