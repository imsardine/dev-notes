# Diagram

  - [Diagram - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagram)

      - A diagram is a SYMBOLIC REPRESENTATION of information using visualization techniques. Diagrams have been used since prehistoric times on walls of caves, but became more prevalent during the Enlightenment.

        Sometimes, the technique uses a three-dimensional visualization which is then projected onto a two-dimensional surface. The word GRAPH is sometimes used as a synonym for diagram.
